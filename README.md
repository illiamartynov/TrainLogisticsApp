# TrainLogisticsApp

TrainLogisticsApp is a Java application for modeling and managing railway logistics infrastructure, including trains, wagons, railway stations, and connections. It allows users to create and manage various types of trains and wagons, simulate train movement, and perform tasks such as wagon attachment, cargo loading, and train routing.


## 🚂 Features

- **Create and manage trains** with information on locomotives, attached wagons, and their destinations.
- **Define various types of wagons** with specific characteristics and unique identification numbers.
- **Simulate train movement** and generate routes based on railway message graph algorithms.
- **Handle collisions** and implement queuing mechanism for trains on the same route.
- **Calculate and update train speeds** based on a speed change algorithm.
- **Display comprehensive reports** on train status, distance traveled, and wagon information.
- **Intuitive menu system** for easy interaction and operation.
